# Q23 Implement Stack using Queues
___

## Q

Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (`push`, `top`, `pop`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyStack` class:

- `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
- `int pop()` Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
- `int top()` Returns the element on the top of the stack.
- `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the stack is empty, `false` otherwise.

Notes:

- You must use only standard operations of a queue, which means that only `push to back`, `peek/pop from front`, `size` and `is empty` operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.

## Sample Input 

__Input__  
["MyStack", "push", "push", "top", "pop", "empty"]  
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]  
__Output__  
[null, null, null, 2, 2, false]  

__Explanation__  
MyStack myStack = new MyStack();  
myStack.push(1);  
myStack.push(2);  
myStack.top(); // return 2  
myStack.pop(); // return 2  
myStack.empty(); // return False  

## Constraints

- 1 <= x <= 9
- At most 100 calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `empty`.
- All the calls to `pop` and `top` are valid.

## 1. My Solution

```py
'''
In this Question, to build stack only using Queue, the permitted operation is "popleft", and "push". This operations exist in the type Deque. Deque also supports operation like "pop", but used only two operations above to make stack only using "Queue".
'''

class MyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        #define with the type deque
        self.q = collections.deque()

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.q.append(x)

    #flip the list, popout 1st element, then flip again
    def pop(self) -> int:
        self.q.reverse()
        pop = self.q.popleft()
        self.q.reverse()
        return pop

    #flip the list, popout 1st element and save, then flip again, append it again.
    def top(self) -> int:
        self.q.reverse()
        top = self.q.popleft()
        self.q.reverse()
        self.q.append(top)
        return top         

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        if self.q:
            return False
        else:
            return True

#for test
obj = MyStack()
obj.push(10)
obj.push(5)
p2 = obj.pop()
print(obj.q)
p3 = obj.top()
print(obj.q)
p4 = obj.empty()
print(p4, obj.q)
```

`self.q = collections.deque` is the most confusing part in the codes above... From now on, remind `self.(var name) = things to assign`. 

Refer to the commentary above the code. Really simple problem.

## 2. Given Solution

```py

class MyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        #define with the type deque
        self.q = collections.deque()

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.q.append(x)
        #after appedning the element, re-sort the list that new input comes first
        for _ in range(len(self.q) - 1):
            self.q.append(self.q.popleft())

    def pop(self) -> int:
        return self.q.popleft()

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.q[0]         

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return len(self.q) == 0
```

Passing through other codes, let's discuss `def push`. This is the function that sort the list. For example, self.q is [1, 2, 3, 4] and append 5 to the list. It becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. However, to make "Stack", we must follow LIFO rule. Simply using the operation "leftpop" can not shape the operation "pop". So locate the input from the last to the first place. Then [5, 1, 2, 3, 4] is the result.

## Overall Review

Implementing stack with Queue is quiet interesting experience. But more need to solve the questions using stack...
