# Q11 Product of Array Except Self
___


## Q
Given an integer array nums, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

## Sample Input

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]  
Output: [24,12,8,6]  

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]  
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

## Constraints
- 2 <= nums.length <= 105
- -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
- The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is __guaranteed__ to fit in a __32-bit__ integer.

## My Solution <- Given Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        tmp1=[1 for i in range(len(nums))]
        tmp2=[1 for j in range(len(nums))]

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i == 0: #for i-1 index
                continue
            tmp1[i] = tmp1[i-1] * nums[i-1]
            
        for j in range(len(nums)):
            if j == 0: #for i-1 index
                continue
            tmp2[j] = tmp2[j-1] * nums[-1-(j-1)]

        tmp3 = list(map(lambda x,y : x*y,tmp1, reversed(tmp2)))
        return tmp3

a = Solution()
nums = [1,2,3,4]
print(a.productExceptSelf(nums))

#Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

Question is really intricated when try to solve without any division. To sovle the problem, let's make an example.

Let an array = [a, b, c, d] What we want for answer is [bcd, acd, abd, abc]. To get answer, you need to multiply right-result to left-result by one and one.  

By "arr1[i] = arr1[i-1] * nums[i-1]", we can get right-direction result. Vice versa, like "arr2[j] = arr2[j-1] * nums[-1-(j-1)]"  

Refer the code block below.


```py
'''
B
↑ ↘
A  AB product up & down then result is next right or left
Each right & left array start with "1"
'''

# Right-direction
  [1 2 3 4]
   1 1 2 6 #multiply with above ↑ way, start from left

# Left-direction
  [1  2  3  4]
  24 12  4  1 #multiply with above ↑ way, start from right
```

As you get the two array(right & left mult result), mult it one by one and then get the final result by using map function.

** How to use map function : map("function", "the values that will pass through the function")  
So in this question we used map(lambda func, list1, list2), to shorten the code for one by one multiplication.

## Overall Review
Not easy to remind the mult algo. Try to think numbers as letters(like math questions...) is the key to the solution. Keep thinking that algo is really close to solving math problem.
