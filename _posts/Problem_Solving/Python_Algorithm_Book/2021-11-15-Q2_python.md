# Q2 Reverse-String
___

## Q
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

## Sample Input
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

## Constraints
- 1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
- s[i] is a printable ascii character.

## 1. My Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        for i in range(len(s)//2):
            a: str = s[i] #save first
            print(a)
            s[i]=s[-(i+1)]
            print(s[i])
            s[-(i+1)] = a

#for testing
s = Solution()
s.reverseString(["a","b","c","d"])
```
Simple Concept. Just saved the first element to temporary 'a' variable, and put the last element(s[-1]) to the first one(s[0]). Keep changing while the loop meets the center. I chose 'len(s)//2', since residue is useless. That's because the center element don't need to be changed.

In my solution, I have to be aware of the type of 's'. I put 
```s.reverseString("hello")``` in my first try.  
In this case, the type of 's' become just string. not list comprise of string.  
Therefore the error __'TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment'__ occurs. Be Careful! Python's type hint is just the 'hint'. It doesn't define the type of the object.

## 2. Given Solution #1
```py
def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
        left += 1
        right -= 1
```
No Commentary is needed for this solution.

## 3. Given Solution #2
According to the book, this is the __'Pythonic'__ way.

```py
def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
    s.reverse()
```
Wow... the method 'reverse' is only provided when using the list.

When if the input is the string, U can use the string slicing method like ```s = s[::-1]```

## Overall Review  
The solution that called 'Pythonic' way makes me shocked. Python library is literally amazing and contains incountable method. I should learn more to use python better.
